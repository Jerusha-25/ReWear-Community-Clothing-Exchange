# 👕 ReWear - Community Clothing Exchange

ReWear is a full-stack web application that empowers local communities to exchange clothes easily, sustainably, and socially. It’s more than just a swap shop—it's a **community-driven circular fashion movement**.

Users can:
- 🔄 List clothing items they no longer need
- 🛍️ Browse items others have posted
- 💬 Communicate and arrange swaps
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Join a trusted, authenticated network of swappers
